# What this talk is not

This is not a

- "Redux is dead!" talk
- "Hooks are the only way to 'React'" talk

I merely want to show you a pattern for leverage React context and hooks to pull
apart complex "global" state to make your life as a developer easier and your
codebase more manageable.

## A note on "single source of truth"

> ...[“single source of truth”] doesn’t mean all data lives in one place. It
> means that for any _particular_ part of data/state, there’s one canonical
> owner.
